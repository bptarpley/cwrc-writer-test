            <ab>Margate, June 16, 1790. </ab>
            <ab>MY visit to your friends is paid, and I </ab>
            <ab>met such a reception as I might expect </ab>
            <ab>from your recommendation-would I could </ab>
            <ab>tell you, that it has answered all the friend- </ab>
            <ab>ly expectations, or rather hopes, you for- </ab>
            <ab>med of it: but you expect an ingenuous ac- </ab>

            <ab>Mrs. Fairfax has been certainly a very </ab>
            <ab>fine woman, and even now has personal ad- </ab>
            <ab>vantages enough to authorise her retain- </ab>
            <ab>ing those pretensions, which it is easy to </ab>
            <ab>see she would, with extreme reluctance, en- </ab>
            <ab>tirely resign.-It is however but justice to </ab>
            <ab>add, that her unwillingness to fade, does </ab>
            <ab>not influence her to keep back the period </ab>
            <ab>when it is fit her daughters should bloom- </ab>
